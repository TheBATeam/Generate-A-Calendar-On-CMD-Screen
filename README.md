# Generate-A-Calendar-On-CMD-Screen
The **calendar program** was one of the first **Batch programs**. I learned some of the basic commands like SET, IF, FOR, etc. from this **calendar program**. On the first view, the code seemed simpler, but the algorithm of all the calculation makes it an incredible creation.

# CALENDAR ON CMD SCREEN | BY JUDAGO

I decided to write a post on it – due to the reason for its **UI {User interface}**. As it was the program that showed GUI-like output of the calendar on the screen. This showed the GUI possibilities on the cmd console and encouraged me to enhance the **batch programming**.

Another batch program named **‘Batch Explorer’** also has amazing UI output effects. I will also write a post on the ‘Batch Explorer’ and its Programmer. But now, we’ll talk a little about the calendar by Judago.

# FEATURES OF CALENDAR IN CMD
The image below shows the output of the calendar program when I entered 2015 as user input. The variables and output pattern is so well arranged that it leaves a **good effect** on the user. The **programmed code** and **algorithms** are also well managed and proper comments are given at the required position in the code. The program was originally created in August 2009.

I must appreciate the programming skills of Judago. I really want to know more about Judago and his other creations. Maybe I’ll post more on them in the future.

The program is coded for the static conditions of **height and width** of the cmd window, i.e. **while it displays the calendar** of any specific year, you can’t change the console window’s size. But, we’ve already made the Box function for this type of dynamic conditions of changing console size. Now, if you want – you can make it more advanced and effective. But I personally like the original one.
